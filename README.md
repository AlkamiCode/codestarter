The Pivot is the first project in Module 3 at the Turing School. Each group are given a legacy project to work with. Code Starter is a microlending platform where users can create code projects and receive micro loans from other users. Code Starter is pivoted from [Jurassic Parka](https://github.com/marlabrizel/jurassic_parka), a clothing store for dinosaurs.
